# Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.
# The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. 
# You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

# IMAGES
$docker build -t <image_name>                 --> Build an image from a Dockerfile
$docker build -t <image_name> . -no-cache     --> Build an image from a Dockerfile without the cache
$docker images     --> To list local images
$docker rmi <image_name>    --> To delete an image
$docker image prune     --> To remove all unused images


#Docker HUB
$docker login -u <username>
$docker push <username>/<image_name>       --> Publish an image to Docker Hub
$docker search <image_name> 
$docker pull <image_name>


# General commands
$docker -d       --> To start the docker daemon
$docker --help
$docker info      --> To display system-wide information


# Containers
#A container is a runtime instance of a docker image. A container will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.
#Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

$docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>    --> To create and run a container from an image with a custom name
$docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>    --> To run a container with and publish a container's port(s) to the host
$docker run -d <image_name>     --> To run a container in background
$docker start|stop <container_name> (or <container-id>)     --> To start or stop an existing container
$docker rm <container_name>   --> To remove a stopped container
$docker exec -it <container_name> sh    --> To open a shell inside a running container
$docker logs -f <container_name>    --> To Fetch and follow the logs of a container
$docker inspect <container_name>  (or <container_id>)     --> To inspect a running container
$docker ps   --> To list currently running containers
$docker ps --all   --> To list all docker containers(running and stopped)
$docker container stats   --> To view resource usage stats
